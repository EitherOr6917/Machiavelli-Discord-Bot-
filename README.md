Machiavelli: A discord bot made by me using the discord.py rewrite library

It has a lot of fun commands, such as kill, cookie, or f, but what I'm currently working on is the Virtù system. Virtù comes from the ideas of Niccolo Machiavelli. 
Machiavelli believed that to be a great ruler, you not only had to be powerful and smart, you also had to be a good person. This didn't mean no bloodshed, nor that one couldn't
utilize fear, it meant that backstabbing wouldn't get you far. As of writing this, the Virtù system rewards users for being active on the server.

It also has some simple moderation features, with more to be added in the future. 

This project is not currently being developed, I'd like to revisit it later using actual databases instead of json files though.
